      <p>In the Fall of 2021, I began my last year at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. For four years, I have witnessed the University’s negligence and disregard for their students and this previous semester was no different. While the issues may change, Carolina always seems to stay the same. Silent Sam set the scene for what I expected the remainder of my years at Carolina: white supremacy, racism, apathy, white saviors, and general inattentiveness. The dominant theme of my third pandemic semester was simply failure. The university failed me once again with the admin’s nonchalant attitude towards the seriousness of both the pandemic and mental health of their students.</p>
      
      <p>The number of student COVID-19 cases had tripled at the end of the first week. I have many assumptions on how the steep increase occurred, but the thought that seems to be most popular among my peers and I are unmasked large gatherings. The single event that caused the increase? The first day of classes’ unofficial Carolina tradition to bring the new semester in by partying all night at fraternities packed wall to wall. Although attending Fraternity Court, or “frat court,” is a personal choice, I was absolutely infuriated with UNC. The university admins know about this tradition. Even when based on a ludicrous assumption that UNC admin did not know of this tradition, frat court is quite literally next to academic buildings. The university has a responsibility to protect all students from the spread of COVID-19, especially if students are going into life-long debt to attend the school. By not setting a boundary or creating a standard on how to approach student life the first week of classes, the university watched nonchalantly while immunocompromised students and community members were tormented with the possibility of their death. </p>
